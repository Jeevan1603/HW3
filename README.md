This is my first VR project. I was instructed to do a room. I was thinking of some ideas and I ended up creating the room in my house. This was a crazy experience. I used some apps to scan my whole room to get a rough 3D Room and i imported them into blender to do some changes. Then I imported the blender file into the project and it worked.
